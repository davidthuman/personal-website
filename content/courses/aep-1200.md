Nano-science is the study of phenomena and manipulation of materials at atomic, molecular, and macro-molecular scales.

Nano-engineering is the design, characterization, production, and application of nano-science.

Working at the 1 - 100 nanometer scale.

Surfaces and Interfaces plat a major role.
- A 10 nm particle has >20% of its atoms on its surface
- Potential for greater control of chemical reactions

Quantum size effects become important.
- Material dimensions similar to quantum mechanical wavelengths (quantum dots)

## Information Processing

What is different from that at the large scale?
- more interface / higher surface area
- physical laws interact differently

Information Processing
- internet
- data centers
- super computers
- cloud storage

Transistor
- a fundamental building block of digital devices
- first invented in 1947 at Bell Labs (Bardeen, Braltain, Schosky); is now the integrate circuit (IC)

Moore's Law
- transistor count per IC doubles very tow years

Use of Transistor
- first used in solid state amplifier
- later became a switch ("on" versus "off")

Transistors

Digital Age
- information is stored and processed digitally
- represented as a binary number (bits)
- codes / conventions to represent
    - ASCII characters: bytes (8 bits) $2^8$
    - 0100 0001 = 65 (base-10)
    - 0100 0010 = 66 (base-10)

Analog Signal -> Music
- better recording
    - more bits
    - faster sampling or more bins

## Transistor and Logic

1101 -> $(1 * 2^3) + (1 * 2^2) + (0 * 2^1) + (1 * 2^0)$ = 8 + 4 + 0 + 1 = 13

Transistor is a solid state switch

Logic Gates
- devices that implement a truth table
