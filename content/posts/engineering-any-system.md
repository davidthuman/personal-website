- Is capitalism steady-state?

- Perfection is impossible to reach unless defined solely by mathematics, but even then measure certainty is still present.
- With this dynamic change, however, the product or system must still be stable and functioning
- Dynamic change must be allowed
- No system or product is perfect at conception
- Perfection can only be rigorously defined through mathematics, and even within math itself, it is impossible to reach. Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem tells us that no consistent system is capable of proving all truths and that the system cannot demonstrate its own consistency. The human language is already full of loosely defined terms that incorporate interpretation, so in an attempt to show that something in perfect mathematics is needed to generate that proof. In order to transfer these physical ideas that are defined within the human language measurements are needed. But with measurements come uncertainties, which then filter into our mathematical landscape that possess holds.
- This un-reachable perfect occurs even in the most simple examples, but humans still live on and with certainty about the painted world around them. Even though perfection cannot be achieved humans can get extremely close to it and for all intents and purposes can safely assume its correctness.

- Another good mathematical, and useful, interpretation of this un-reachable perfect is with the asymptote. Given our function < f(t) = 1 - e^(-t) >, we can see at t = 0, f(0) = 0. But as x increases in value f(t) gets closer and closer to 1. Now in the finite time set, the one which you, I, and all other humans live in, f(t) will never reach 1 a.k.a. perfect. But if we allow our function to run for infinite time, mathematically speaking, f(t) will reach 1.
- So what now? Perfect doesn’t exist; nothing in our lives is certain; why do we even do this? Although perfection cannot be achieved, we still possess its abstraction in our minds
