## General Framework


## Religion or Philosophy or Nothing?


## From Physics to Existentialism


## Why Existentialism


## Sea of endless purposes, but you can pick one


- With your picked purpose, a clear path can be made
- To move around intellectually one must first pick a general framework to work within. Now although this grounding framework cannot be used as a proven fact in an argument, if we are to build ideas from a first-principles standpoint these general frameworks are your starting assumption of how that world works. So what are the options? There are two obvious categories to pick from: religion and philosophy.
- I believe there is no objective purpose in life.
