Choose the path that you want to take.  Fuck your formal education, what others tell you to do, or what your parents want you to do.  This is your own life that you are living right now, and you only have one of it; so do what you want.

Strong words that often fail to float in the reality.  The truth of the world, at the moment, is that optimizing for happiness or passion does not always lead to your best life.  You cannot feed yourself or your children off your passion or happiness, that is left for the extremely lucky individuals who obtain both the skill and the luck to flip a coin for heads fifty times in a row.  But sometimes life is not about living optimally for the exact environment you are in.  How else would have our fish ancestors transitioned from sea to land?

This sentiment is felt in a quote of Ghandi, "Be the change you want to see in the world."  This is echoed in Santre's Existentialist writings, the way in which you act, shows your design of human nature.  So yes, follow your dreams, not because it is the right thing to do, but because it is what we should be doing.
