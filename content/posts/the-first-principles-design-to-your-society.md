## Existentialism

General Framework

Religion or Philosophy or Nothing?

From physics to Existentialism

Why Existentialism

Sea of endless purposes, but you can pick one

With your picked purpose, a clear path can be made

To move around intellectually one must first pick a general framework to work within. A framework is needed to give your thoughts motivation and relativity compared with others.

## Why Humans Collect

The objective biology of it

We want to live to reproduce

But why would anyone want to live in pain?

We collect to make everyone’s lives better

What does better mean?

## Empathy

Empathy alone cannot get your society to the full connect that is needed, there must also be an aspect of trust

## Engineering any System

No system or product is perfect at conception

Dynamic change must be allowed

With this dynamic change, however, the product or system must still be stable and functioning

Perfection is impossible to reach unless defined solely by mathematics, but even then measure certainty is still present.

Is capitalism steady-state?

## Freedom or Equality / Individualism or Community

Freedom

## Crime and Punishment

The United States’ prison system needs reform. The first weird property is the fact that there exist private prisons that are not run by the government. As a baseline, allowing a private company to profit off the functionality or rule of a law does not help the citizens under that governance. An example of this is private car insurance companies; quite a lucrative business model for a mandatory rule by the government. And yet again we see this with private prisons. Profiting off a mandatory functionality of the land seems to be an act of ripping off the citizens. It is not a choice of the consumer anymore; they do not have the power to withhold purchasing if the private companies do not fit their needs. Moreover, profiting off the rehabilitation of your other citizens is immoral and improper in a connected society. So it is clear that the running of prisons should not be done in the private sector, but what else needs to be done to improve their functionality? First, we must go back and think to ourselves of ‘why do we have prisons in the first place?’ It seems that some actions must be taken against a citizen who does something illegal, immoral, or improper.

## The Economy

## Steady-State Society

To think that Capitalism is the steady state or even the best economic system that humans can think of is a slap in the face of the engineering mindset. But even with that, it is true to say that it is the strongest and most powerful system that is in place today (2021). We can add higher order Socialist terms to help correct some of the downfalls of Capitalism, but whiching to Socialism as our economic system would not be beneficial.

No one has ever created a perfect system on the first try, or even the second, or the third (we must keep in mind the asymptotic framework around the term perfect). The mindset of an engineer is to look at the current system (maybe even disregarding it as a whole), acknowledge the factors involved in optimization, and try and build better. I am sure that the creators of Capitalism (or atleast the Founders who implemented it in the creation of the United States of America in 1776) did not have as much information as I have now, so I do not believe they got it perfect on their first or second go around of thinking about these systems.

I have no ideas what this new and better system will look like or how (at its core) it will function. Did we predict the full form of the iPhone before Steve Jobs willed it into existence? Did people even imagine that communication in the form of electricity through the telegram was even possible before it was invented? At this point, it is not about trying to develop this system (this will happen later and I am happy to be a part of it), we first need to acknowledge that it is possible that a better system can be created and this should not scare people.
