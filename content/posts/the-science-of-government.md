Or as John Adams says, the "Divine Science of Politicks."

Before anything, I want to first lay down some common definitions so we get a similar sense of what we are dealing with here.  To communicate effectively, we must have a strong basis to build upon.

government (noun): the body of persons that contribute the governing authority of a political unit or organization

governing (verb): to exercise continuous sovereign authority over

politics (noun): the art or science of government

I want to establish a set of axioms that can be used to provide and prove a correct path for certain policy and legislative actions, within a given meta-goal.  I have already started to create these axioms, or rather ideas as they have not been matured yet, with Website DMT.
