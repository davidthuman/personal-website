# Tucker Carlson

December 7th, 2021

Tucker Carlson Tonight, hosted on Fox News by Tucker Carlson, has been the top-rated cable news show for many years. If you have ever seen clips of his show, you will realize the type of political beliefs and audience that Carlson attempts to attract.

Before Trump Era politics, the Republican party was a mellow mix of libertarianism, quasi-logic, and bigotry. And Tucker Carlson perfectly portrayed this. Immigration issues? We need to support Americans first. Social programs? The nation will raise taxes on everyone to pay for spending. Police violence? Just do not commit crimes. The logic is harsh and unforgiving, but it resonates with a lot of Americans.

This pre-Trump republican bases a lot of their guiding values on whether a policy choice will improve the economy, or whether benefits given out by the government will actually reach them. This is actually the logic of most Americans, democrats and republicans just differ in the path of these policy choices and maybe the level of bigotry embedded in their thinking.

Often on Tucker’s show, he brings on an extremely weak guest. Someone who does not know how to combat the generic republican talking points that Tucker will always bring up or someone with outrageously liberal or extreme values that is a cakewalk to debate them. This is why so many people love watching him, he can portray a sound, logical libertarian who cares about the American people. That is a pretty easy sell for anyone.

And I would not say that Tucker has not deviated from this natural pattern as Trump-era republicanism made its way into the mainstream. People like Tucker Carlson and Ben Shapiro have such longevity and a large viewer base because they portray a logical, reasonable point of view. If they switched to the outrageousness of Trumpism politics they might spike in popularity and media coverage, but they would definitely lose some credibility from their base and decrease in view once the hype of Trumpism dies out.

Grouping figures like Tucker and Shapiro to Alex Jones, or Trump-like politicians of Marjorie Taylor Greene or Madison Cawthorn is an incorrect analysis of the Republican party and shows a misunderstanding of the nuances that each group holds. Although they do overlap in supporters, conservatives, and republicans, there are many people who love the commentary that Tucker brings but could not imagine watching the ramblings of Alex Jones. Moreover, there were many times that Tucker disagreed with Trump’s actions during his presidency, while people like Greene would always support and act in alliance with Trump.

This is not to say that Tucker Carlson has good points on his show, after all both he and Rachel Maddow had to legally define their cable news shows as opinion and entertainment because of lawsuits. The important thing here is to recognize that the right is full of different sections with different opinions. Tucker’s show is the number one watched cable news show for a reason; people on the right want to support strongly grounded, logical people, even if Tucker's good political characteristics are more of an act to trick the viewers.
