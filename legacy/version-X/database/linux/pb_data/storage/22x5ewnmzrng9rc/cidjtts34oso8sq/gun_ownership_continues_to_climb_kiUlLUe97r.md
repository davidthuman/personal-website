# Gun Ownership Continues to Climb

April 22nd, 2022

According to the Pew Research Center, around 40 percent of Americans now live in a household with a gun.  Depending on where you live within the United States, this number may seem extremely high.  On average, if you look at the house that neighbors you on your left, and then on your right, one of the three of you has a gun within their home.

From some of the most recent data, the total gun count in the U.S. is around 434 million, which is actually more than the total population of the United States, at 332 million.  Counted in 2019, the number of smartphones in active use in the United States totals around 299 million.  In 2018, the percentage of households with computers was about 90 percent.  Even looking at household appliances, counted in 2021, 80 percent of U.S. households have washing machines, and 90 percent have refrigerators.  The question is now, when compared to items that are used every day by a larger percentage of the population, why are there still more guns in the United States?

We can first look at the makeup of the 434 million guns that are located in the United States.  If we look at the number of registered weapons by state, we see that Texas has 1 million, 518,000 in Florida, 423,000 in Virginia, and 406,000 in California.  However, if we count the registered weapons in the U.S., it is nowhere close to the total count of guns.  But out of those 400 million-something guns, most are unlicensed and untraceable.

There is a clear problem and imbalance with American gun laws.  For a product that has a federally legal market, the number of unlicensed guns shows that some part of the implementation is faulty.

Out of all registered voters, 45 percent strongly support, 23 percent somewhat agree, 14 percent somewhat oppose, and 18 percent strongly oppose “stricter gun control laws in the United States.”  Among these registered voters, the partisan split between Democrats and Republicans is large, with 75 percent of Democrats strongly supporting and 37 percent of Republicans strongly opposing.

But the gun problem is not that simple.  Having better registration systems, tracing, and background checks are clearly good and important goals to achieve, but these do not help combat the majority of unlicensed guns floating around the country, or the presumable illegal importation problem that allows these guns to come in unfiltered.  

If we look to an idealized society as our north star for policy decisions, it seems that guns are an unnecessary utility to have for everyday citizens to have.  Hopefully, protection can be placed into the hands of the government authorities who are trained to do so.  Some may point to the origin of the citizen’s right to bear arms to defend against an authoritarian government, however, the certain United States government has a plethora of checks and balances to protect itself against an authoritative leader, unlike the original British crown.  But in reality, banning guns in America is an unrealistic policy choice.  The implementation of collecting guns, finding the untraceable-unlicensed weapons, and public pushback make the feat basically impossible.

The main policy that legislators should be working towards is fighting against the illegal weapons that are in America.  We need to decrease the ratio of unlicensed to licensed weapons that are in the United States and push to have stronger filters to catch illegal weapons from coming into the states in the first place.
