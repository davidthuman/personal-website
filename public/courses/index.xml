      <description>Nano-science is the study of phenomena and manipulation of materials at atomic, molecular, and macro-molecular scales.
Nano-engineering is the design, characterization, production, and application of nano-science.
Working at the 1 - 100 nanometer scale.
Surfaces and Interfaces plat a major role.
A 10 nm particle has &amp;gt;20% of its atoms on its surface Potential for greater control of chemical reactions Quantum size effects become important.
Material dimensions similar to quantum mechanical wavelengths (quantum dots) Information Processing # What is different from that at the large scale?</description>
