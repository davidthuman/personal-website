After I graduated high school, I have been attending Cornell University, enrolled in the College of Engineering as an Engineering Physics major. I have always loved math as a child and developed a love for physics and politics as I went on in high school.\nThe engineering mindset, as I have learned, has been my first line of thinking for as long as I could remember; it is actually what I wrote my college admissions essay on when I applied to Cornell! My future goals, however, do not directly pertain to my pursued degree in \u0026lsquo;Engineering Physics\u0026rsquo;. My goal is to be a politician, or at least effect United States politics.\nAs my setting changed when I moved to Ithaca, New York, I realized within the next couple of years that my main goal in life is to help people. Realized how I interacted with people as I was growing up, it should have been clear that I was already pointed in this direction. The decision to go into politics and not a STEM field is one mostly based on logistics; I would need to be a world-class engineer to help many people, but as a politician, I could more easily affect the lives of others in a positive manner.\nHowever, this does not mean I plan to drop my devotion to STEM. My dream job fall at the cross-section between computer science and politics. I could go on and on into the systems, frameworks, and ideas that flow out of the mind of an engineer turned politician, so that is what this website is for. Here is my application to be your next representative.

The first weird property is the fact that there exist private prisons that are not run by the government. As a baseline, allowing a private company to profit off the functionality or rule of a law does not help the citizens under that governance. An example of this is private car insurance companies; quite a lucrative business model for a mandatory rule by the government. And yet again we see this with private prisons. Profiting off a mandatory functionality of the land seems to be an act of ripping off the citizens. It is not a choice of the consumer anymore; they do not have the power to withhold purchasing if the private companies do not fit their needs. Moreover, profiting off the rehabilitation of your other citizens is immoral and improper in a connected society. So it is clear that the running of prisons should not be done in the private sector, but what else needs to be done to improve their functionality? First, we must go back and think to ourselves of ‘why do we have prisons in the first place?’ It seems that some actions must be taken against a citizen who does something illegal, immoral, or improper.\nThe Economy # Steady-State Society # To think that Capitalism is the steady state or even the best economic system that humans can think of is a slap in the face of the engineering mindset. But even with that, it is true to say that it is the strongest and most powerful system that is in place today (2021). We can add higher order Socialist terms to help correct some of the downfalls of Capitalism, but whiching to Socialism as our economic system would not be beneficial.\nNo one has ever created a perfect system on the first try, or even the second, or the third (we must keep in mind the asymptotic framework around the term perfect). The mindset of an engineer is to look at the current system (maybe even disregarding it as a whole), acknowledge the factors involved in optimization, and try and build better. I am sure that the creators of Capitalism (or atleast the Founders who implemented it in the creation of the United States of America in 1776) did not have as much information as I have now, so I do not believe they got it perfect on their first or second go around of thinking about these systems.\nI have no ideas what this new and better system will look like or how (at its core) it will function. Did we predict the full form of the iPhone before Steve Jobs willed it into existence? Did people even imagine that communication in the form of electricity through the telegram was even possible before it was invented? At this point, it is not about trying to develop this system (this will happen later and I am happy to be a part of it), we first need to acknowledge that it is possible that a better system can be created and this should not scare people.\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/posts/a-mathematical-representation/","title":"A Mathematical Representation","section":"Posts","content":" Why Math # A true understanding of any system (a system can really represent anything: the United States’ economy, the hydrogen atom in quantum mechanics, a sports game, etc.) must be scientific. When investigating anything, a question of \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; can be asked at any level of the system. If we keep asking why, we will inevitably reach the discipline of physics, where the language is mathematics. To understand is to quantify, and if things are too heuristic or qualitative, we must create a mapping or model to understand.\nOn the surface, many systems are understood in a heuristic manner. A loose combination of words and feelings with no real rigor towards a mathematically defined understanding. Think of things like a feeling of angry or the taste of a steak with a hint of rosemary. Without much thought these things are described and understood with a string of words and your own personal conscious and subconscious feelings. However, this does not mean that these things cannot be scientifically understood. A feeling of angry can be defined by certain levels of neurotransmitters or neuropeptides, which is caused by some stimuli, then affecting higher level bodily functions such as body temperature or arousal. As taste can be descried by the levels of certain molecules and how these are interpreted by your taste buds.\nLimitations of Logic # A tangent from the above section in necessary. Like in most sciences, one can pledge their time to theory or experiment. These often progress a differing rates; sometimes our theory cannot be experimentally proven with the current technology, and sometimes experimental observations cannot be understood through theory. This dynamic, the attempt to understand and to use, can be seen as an optimization problem in other areas of life.\nAlthough the goal of any scientific person is to understand through theory, waiting to solve a problem until you have perfectly mapped out all the mechanisms is not advantageous for society (this is akin to waiting until you have the perfect setup before starting a project or learning a new skill, it is procrastination). So although we would like to create mathematical representations for our problems, roadblocks when creating this representation cannot holt our main object, to solve the problem at hand.\nIn the area of politics and society, heavy theory or a mathematical representation of problems and guiding principles lack maturity and scientific rigor. This is not because the social sciences lack intelligent people. The low-level mechanics of these topics is the human conscience. These humans interact with other humans with scaling principles that can be seen on the macro level. The macro can be observed and studied through communities and countries, but these observations are on natural experiments, ones where variables are sometimes unknown and unaccounted for. So why not have macro level experiments? There are many reason, some ethical, some through experimental bias, why we cannot experiment on whole societies and countries. So why not have simulations? For real and complex simulations, an understanding of each individual unit (this tracking an atom, but now we are tracking human action and thought) is necessary. This is where the theory becomes harder. Bla Bla Bla. We have not solve human consciousness.\nArithmetic of the Abstract # Optimizing Human Happiness # Integrals over time and summations over people are the main two operations th\nLet try to write a simple model for human happiness.\nFirst, we will assume that happiness is a scalar, just a regular value, say $h \\in \\mathbb{R}$. So how do we calculate happiness? To be simple, we will say that happiness $h$ is a function of multiple variables $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$. I do not how many variables go into defining human happiness, or the nature of these variables (positive things), so we will assume a simple model of three variables $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$ for $1 \\leq i \\leq 3$.\nSo now we have a function with multiple variables, that are all assumed to be continuous, with a function that is assumed to be continuous, we can start analyzing it with multiple variable calculus, and start observing its behavior.\nSo with one human, what are some factors (variables) that go into determining (calculating) their happiness? The time of the day does affect a person\u0026rsquo;s happiness, but not directly. Other factors like energy, hungry, and their significant other\u0026rsquo;s happiness score. These variable choice are also not easy to handle.\nenergy is another arbitrary value of this person\u0026rsquo;s life that would also need a discussion to figure out. hungry is a more refind value; its calculation is somewhat scientifically defined, or could easily be defined as linearly decreasing function with respect to time. Once initialize, its value decreases as $-bt$ where $t$ is time and $b$ is some value correlated with a person\u0026rsquo;s metabolism. Here, we use the help of other scientific research to define our base values. their significant other\u0026rsquo;s happiness score open up the connect to others, that more comples relationship between variables occurs. Multiple objects appear in one space, or that at every time step (must be much less than all human time scales, but large enough to help runtime), a calculate is done, which will involve multiple other function to call, doing more calculations.

We will leave the discussion of the nature of these rules for later, and focus on how to treat and process the ‘rule breakers’. Lets first start with the trivial solution.\nThe trivial solution would be that of zero, doing nothing. If the thought of doing nothing to a person who breaks a particular rule seems reasonable, then the rule itself is probably at fault for the illogical solution. Lets take an easy example, murder. Pondered elsewhere in this website, the goal of building a society includes actively promoting the well-being of your citizens. The killing of one of your citizens, therefore, goes in direct opposition of this goal and should prompt the creation of a rule. Now if someone murders another, going in direct opposition of the goal of the society, the ‘rule break’ process should trigger. If this process is the trivial solution, i.e. no process, this person may murder again. This solution is not the society actively promoting the well-being of their citizens and should be concluded to be incorrect. If we look to another example of theft, a similar conclusion should be made; this theft is most likely decreasing the well-being of the person at the other end of the theft and is then a concern of the society at large (But it is increasing the well-being of the person who is stealing! Discussion of this point inquiries into the timeline of crime and average well-being as well as why people creak rules in the first place. I will hopefully discuss this later.)\nLets jump rapidly to the opposite end of the solution spectrum to execution. This is a quick and dirty way of dealing with citizens that break the rules. The only pro, and I mean only, is that this person cannot break any more rules in your society. The cons list is quite deep, but I will explain a few. First, this person may be a citizen of your society so executing them should be classified under opposite to promoting the well-being of your citizens. Moreover on this point, who givens anyone the authority to take the life of another human being? Self-defense and war are more nuanced examples, but when their are options that don’t involve the killing of another human, these are the better paths to take. You can sentiment of ‘an eye for an eye’ in ancient laws such as Hammurabi’s Code, but as the hard-to-trace quote goes “An eye for an eye will leave everyone blind.” Taking the life of another should be a last resort decision, so what solutions fall between an action of nothing and of execution?\nThe United States’ prison system needs reform.

The idea of the website ‘wethepeople.com’ at first was going to be site where clear, detailed information about politics, elections, Congress would be easily accessible to all. I wanted summaries of legislature that were going through Congress, outlines of candidates’ polices and ideas, as well as a history of all politician’s past action for an increased amount of accountability. This, however, was more work than I was both able and capable of doing, so it was placed in the back of my mind for later reference.\nI then enter college where I learn how to code, and how to learn to code. Although none of my actual classes have taught me web development or app development, I began to teach myself these things. Learning to code on the internet, for free, is very easy as long as you do it. So at this point in my life (July 22nd, 2021), I have the ability to develop a website that looks goo enough for people to use.\nHowever, there was some mental development that happened in-between these two time points. If you look into the Modern Senate page (I will make you track back in the links to find it) you can see the brainstorming behind an application quickly termed ‘Document, Voting, and Argument Database’. In short, I wanted an application that shrink down the arguments made for or against legislature in Congress, pin them to an actual word, phase, or paragraph in the bill, and allow the public to easily access this information. An Adobe Acrobat Reader on steroids, with a connected network and database. We can see a trend here, minimize the amount of friction between the United States’ public and their political processes.\nSo now we have an idea that one person cannot possibly do on their own and one that needs to convince politicians to use it. Mixing these ideas and adding as open-source aspect to the information gather, we arrive at the website I am slowly building right now.\nI still want the name ‘We The People’, and I also think taking a deep dive into the laws that govern our country is foundational, so the idea is to create a forum-type website that discusses the words that make up our laws. For people who want to join, they will be able to comment arguments on legislative documents that can be seen by everyone else on the side. In that way, we are outsourcing some of the information collection and creation to our users. Other information about voting history and policy proposal from our politicians can be webscraped from government and politician site. I would also like to include some type of information processing backend to see trends in language contained in our laws and attempt to make broader connection with that.\nLegislation Version Control # July 17th, 2023\nA report from the Select Committee on the Modernization of Congress cites issues that Congress has with collaboration and civility, support agencies, and evidence-based policymaking.\nFrom the II. Background and Need For Recommendations,\n\u0026ldquo;3. Members contribute to the legislative process when bills they’ve previously introduced are incorporated into larger bills. The public, however, has limited options for tracking these individual member contributions to larger legislation. The Committee received testimony supporting a better and clearer accounting that enhances transparency and makes member involvement in legislation clearer, particularly when standalone bills are incorporated into larger legislation or ‘‘omnibus’’ packages. While members can currently publicize their own contributions through press releases and other means, there is no formal, publicly accessible way for tracking detailed legislative history. Furthermore, the ‘‘related bills’’ tab on Congress.gov does not provide sufficiently comprehensive information and does not always accurately encapsulate all or most related bills, particularly across multiple sessions of Congress. At the Committee’s Member Day Hearing on April 15, 2021, it was suggested that incorporating hyperlinks and implementing a track changes style system for Congress.gov would provide transparency and a clearer accounting of the legislative process.\u0026rdquo;\nVersion control, or source control, is the best practice for tracking and managing changes to software. GitHub, which uses Git, is an company owned by Microsoft that enables both individuals and companies to track and manage their software through their cloud service.\nFirst, there should be a standardized text format uses throughout the United States government. PDFs and other web-based displays should still be used, however, when version control is involved, having an easy-to-edit text-based file to track is important. Moreover, with the grow in text-processing softwares and large language models (LLMs), having an file format that is easily processed by a computer is important. Markdown would be a great universal format for behind-the-scenes document files. Markdown provides lightweight formatting to plain text that is human-readable but still provides standard and important formatting options.\nWith documents now formatted in Markdown, version control software is able to track all text insertions, word edits, or merges that come when creating legislation.\nIn the end, utilizing technology enables our government to have a more transparent legislative process. Congress.gov is a good start, but improvements can and should be made.\nOnline Forum-like Communication # \u0026ldquo;4. There is currently no tool offered to committee chairs and/ or ranking members who wish to solicit private feedback from committee members on committee operations.\u0026rdquo;\nMaking posts, adding comments to reports, linking to interesting research papers are all important when building an online community with a shared interest. Private emails are a way to send feedback to an individual or group, however, giving an option to make this comment public is important. Public feedback sparks discussion, and incorporates different viewpoints that may be impossible to create via multiple one-on-one conversations.\nCongress-member Profiles # \u0026ldquo;9. Members and staff can have difficulty identifying colleagues who share mutual policy interests, which can inhibit productive collaboration on policy. Informal collaboration happens through caucuses, listservs, the e-dear colleague system, and organically through member and staff-level relationships, but it can still be difficult to identify members to collaborate that have interests in specific topics. Some of these current tools, such as email listservs and the e-dear colleague system, are outdated or inefficient ways to find partners for collaboration at the beginning stages of the legislative process.\u0026rdquo;\nThis is more of a personal opinion, but I believe that open-source is better than closed-source in the long run. This does not have to mean no data or information is allowed to be privates, but build, developing, and researching in the public-eye, or at least within Congress, should be the best practice.\nExtending off of the version control software for legislation, members of Congress should possess profiles where other members can view their work. If one member is going on a bill, gather research and other data, outside members should be able to comment, suggest changes, or merge and collaborate pervious work.\nDiscussion Pods # This section deviates from the discussion of a large software to help members of Congress be more efficient and effective with their time, however, the bolstering of civility and genuine conversations, which may be in-person, are within the scope.\n\u0026ldquo;7. Although there occasionally may be bipartisan events for House members sponsored by outside entities, there is no neutral party within the House of Representatives offering regular, bipartisan gatherings focused on helping members find common ground and mutual understanding.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;10. Several outside organizations have created models for facilitating private conversations between members with the goal of identifying and fostering common ground. However, there is a lack of awareness about these resources, in part because the House does not provide information on formal opportunities for facilitated conversations for members wishing to use them.\u0026rdquo; \u0026ldquo;13. Even as the private sector experiments with and sees success with flexible shared workspaces that foster collaboration and creativity, the House remains very traditional in how it assigns its very limited office space for its staff. Currently the only flex space available is set up for short meetings and there is no place on the House campus designed specifically for staff from multiple offices to work together and collaborate on an idea.\u0026rdquo;\nFrom the public view, especially through the view of social media, members of the House of Representatives seem to be extremely partisan. Whether this is just for show (this is true), the fact that loud, angry voices get the most views (also true), the representatives are probably more civil behind closed doors or in private conversations.\nHowever, actual small-group discussions between the left and the right, having at every level of seniority, is probably not the most likely occurrence. I doubt that more junior-level representatives want to \u0026ldquo;waste\u0026rdquo; their time having non-serous discussions with members of the opposite party. We will force them.\nAs stated above, people, when given a spotlight or a platform, may act in disingenuous ways. The verbal antics that occur during House floor debates can be childish. However, when talking one-on-one with someone, their public persona tends to dissolve. I would like to find research on if the number of participants or perceived viewership of a conversation or discussion affects the content of that discussion.\n"},{"id":8,"href":"/posts/engineering-any-system/","title":"Engineering Any System","section":"Posts","content":" Is capitalism steady-state?

So maybe freedom is not as strong as we first thought.\nThe question for building any society to break down the needed and desired features. With this, you will also need to provide the goal of your society, something to guide the implementers in their quest. Without this baseline goal (may sometimes be compared to that of a mission statement in another reading), the reasoning and decisions for you implementation are backed by nothing.\nA wonderful framework for thinking about why humans (the goal) build a society is through tribal society and living. This framework takes advantage of the Dunbar number. In this tribal society, members know and trust everyone around them. So they should expect the best out of each other, not only because they need to survive together but also because these people are friends, so a treatment of respect is expected.\nIndividualism is somewhat of a myth generated by a heavy swing opposite from the monarchy of England. To say that you are a true individual is physically and factually wrong. The life you live today, the materials that are in front of you, and the relationships you hold, are all a product of a community effort. Even your own personal experiences and thoughts have been shaped by the people around you. Arguably everything you know has been touched and affected by other humans, both known and unknown. This individualistic mindset also shortens the scope at which you think. In their day-to-day lives, how many people think 10 generations after them, both in and out of their future heritage? The scope of the problems they think about is small; they do not worry about how the collective society will live 200 years down the line. People tend to worry about their individual problems, and if we are lucky, the problems of their family and friends. This is not completely their fault, however, as the variety of problems an individual faces, in developed western countries that is, can often be that of the mind. After working your generic 9-5, you face problems of your happiness, you People living in poverty, too, face problems that have consequences in the very short term. People need to feed themselves and their families, they need to pay their bills and, as a result, trade their time for a solution to these problems. Why would someone with depression or someone without money to feed themselves or their children care about the humans who will live 200 years from now?\nLet us dive deep into this broad statement \u0026ldquo;Individualism is somewhat of a myth generated by a heavy swing opposite from the monarchy of England..\u0026rdquo;\nTaken from the Individualism Wikipediap page, \u0026ldquo;Individualism is the moral stance, political philosophy, ideology and social outlook that emphasizes the intrinsic worth of the individual. Individualists promote the exercise of one\u0026rsquo;s goals and desires and to value independence and self-reliance and advocate that interests of the individual should achieve precedence over the state or a social group while opposing external interference upon one\u0026rsquo;s own interests by society or institutions such as the government. Individualism is often defined in contrast to totalitarianism, collectivism and more corporate social forms.\nIt seems that the term \u0026ldquo;was first introducted as a pejorative by utopian socialists such as the Owenites in the late 1830s, although it is unclear if they were influenced by Saint-Simonianism or came up with it independently\u0026rdquo; Etymology, Individualism\nFreedom must also be defined. Today in American politics, and life in general, the word \u0026lsquo;freedom\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;being free\u0026rsquo; carries more connation than it health for such an important idea. America\u0026rsquo;s strong emotional connection to this word has historical context; ideas of freedom and liberty were some of the roots that grounded the American Revolution. During this revolutionary era the idea of freedom was more concrete. Colonists could look easily point to their English rulers and dream of a society outside the boundary of their authority. This idea of freedom, for the majority of the colonists, was crude and heavily circumstantial, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t need to be a thorough, it just needed to be developed enough to start and end the revolution. Although America is still young, we are not at this underdeveloped stage anymore; our definition of \u0026lsquo;freedom\u0026rsquo; should, therefore, not be as well.\nThe stress on the development of the idea of freedom is not a random one. It is one of the groundworks for the American Experiment, but an appeal to tradition is not what is driving this thought. Freedom of thought, of expression, personal freedom, these are all ideas that seem to represent a positive society. And I\u0026rsquo;m sure the Founding Fathers knew why they were picking this pillar to build upon. So what is freedom exactly, and how is it integrated into your society and life?\nAs is common with exploring the spectrum of an idea, we will look first at the extreme and see how we develop from there. One the first side of the spectrum we have absolute freedom. With this a person is free to do whatever action they please. They can kill, they can build, they can think and shout. Place this absolutely free person in a world by themselves, and there seems to be no conflict. If we add other people, however, certain allowed actions seem undesirable. If two humans are absolutely free interact, fighting and murder is on the table. And if these people need to work together inside of a societal unit, one killing the other would be at the detriment of the society at large. Point being: absolute freedom is not the freedom we are looking to implement in our society. Even if Americans don\u0026rsquo;t realize this, it is already build into the United States legal system. People are forced to abide by the rule of law, to pay taxes, and give up their time to attend jury duty,\nNow lets look at the other side of the spectrum. I don\u0026rsquo;t think a strong debate is needed to turn away from a society with absolutely no freedom or autonomy. We all can agree that any form of slavery is terrible and it seems completely undesirable to have no control under any or your choices or actions. Point being: people should be allowed to do what they want and have autonomy in their lives.\nSo how do we logical combine these two points: one of avoiding absolute freedom while still letting people act as they please? Where to we cross the line between a free personal action and one that causes destress in your society?\n"},{"id":11,"href":"/posts/modern-senate/","title":"Modern Senate","section":"Posts","content":" Splitting up the group: The total count of Senate members in the United States Congress is 100.

Having this information online and in a spreadsheet format would be a much quicker way to relay all of this information. Likewise, the scheduled 15 minute voting periods are slow and archaic. With the development of technology, communication has sped up exponentially. Having to relay your vote to one human being over physical speech is far slower than an online vote with the click of a button. An old 15 minute voting period (that usually goes over time) can now be condensed into a 1 minute or even 10-second time slot. Moreover, if this system is online (hopefully connected to the smartphone of the Congressperson, maybe even within the closed network of the Capital), they could pre-lock their vote anytime before the bill’s voting period. Controlling Dynamic Change in your System When creating and developing a system with the goal of making it better, one must be able to change that system. If we allow this dynamic change to happen to our system there can be short-term highs and lows of functionality, with long-term growth overall. Without this dynamic change allowed, growth will be slow and sluggish. One problem that arises from allowing dynamic change to happen is the stress that it puts on the functionality of your system. Even though the long-term growth is positive and your system’s functionality will improve, if we look at discrete chunks of time, there is a chance that your system is functioning very poorly. Now, this is not a problem if people or other systems are not relying on the functionality of your system, but if they are, you must do this in mind when attempting to implement improvements. With the two goals of overall improvement of your system and high working functionality at all times, you must find the correct level of allowed change to balance these two factors. If we place this framework on the United States government, we can develop some interesting ideas. For one, if we trust that the Founding Fathers were smart men, we could reason why they made our government system so resistant to change. We would hope that they had their citizens in mind and their decisions were made to secure a stable level of governmental functionality. Ideas for Research What are the optimal group sizes for effective and efficient communication, debate, and decision-making? We need our Senator to communicate with high efficiency. They are the elected officials/representatives that are making decisions for the citizens, so we should expect them to be as informed as they can be within the given time frame of a bill. These elected officials are clearly not experts in the majority of the topics that they are supposed to be debating. Of course, there can be some Senators with forms of college degrees that would grant them some expertise in a small area of focus, but the majority of Senators are not. First, it is hard to be an expert in a scientific field that has barely progressed, that is, there has been comparatively little research done in the field of proper ‘governments and societies’ for anyone to be an expert on it. Politics is a hard science where there is little trial and error and seemingly no solid theory except in psychology where the extrapolations are near impossible. So it seems that the ideas and argumentative points given by our Senators need to be commented on by an outside source. This could be the citizens, as it is quite hard for them to be biased against themselves, or a panel of experts, which can be easily biased or stacked to a certain side. This is where a large degree of openness comes in handy. If the Senators’ ideas and argumentative points are clearly labeled and open to the public, we will both have a criticism stream from the citizens and from a now open panel (or decentralized panel cough, cough block-chain of experts share their opinions of the matter). This idea of openness and allowing outsider criticism is nothing new. We have the Senate floor televised for everyone to see. The point and optimization that is occurring here are to decrease the amount of ‘friction’ there is in order to increase the amount in which they occur. You want to make it easier for your citizens to participate in the political endeavor. To decrease friction, the Document, Voting, and Argument Database (DVAD) How long should debates/discussions last? Of course, in theory, we would want our debates to last infinite time as to discuss all relative facts and argumentative points, but this is not possible nor realistic. If all relevant data is available without a long access time then the time factor mostly plays on how humans intake, process, and reorganize the information. At a baseline, this seems to rely on how fast humans can understand and draw conclusions from a certain amount of data. Assuming that most of these processes will take more than a day, how long can humans intake and think about a certain set of data points before slowing down? How should breaks be incorporated into the day to keep the minds of the Senators shark? Assuming that there are multiple bills on the floor, we should only one block of discussion per bill per day (this block could enclose multiple breaks), unless the bill has a very high priority. Below needs to be organized The Scheduling Process for Bills Let us first have a look at some scheduling algorithms and some terms that define them. Scheduling Algorithm: strategy used to pick a ready task for execution to the processor. the strategy used to decide which bills will be debated on what date, for how long, and when they should be voted on by the Senate. Process terms: r : ready time of adding to the queue s : start time of execution f : finish time of execution d : absolute deadline Preemptive: the running task can be temporarily suspended to execute another task. If debate has started for a bill, the Senate can shift the focus to another bill. Non-preemptive: the running task cannot be suspended until completion or until it is blocked. If debate has started for a bill, it must be debated until a final vote has been reached. Static or Dynamic: are decisions based on parameters that change with time? Fixed priority vs. dynamic priority? Heuristic or Optimal: can you prove that the algorithm is optimal in terms of certain criteria or not? Online or Offline: are the decisions made prior to knowledge of task activations (offline), or are they taken at run time based on the set of active tasks (online)? Average Response Time: a metric to optimize/minimize Response Time: R = f - r Average Response Time: average of all the response times of all the processes in a queue. Once a bill has been sponsored and proposed, the Senate would want to minimize the debate time to get the bill voted on more quickly. First Come, First Served (FCFS): non-preemptive, Online, Heuristic FCFS is rather unpredictable: response times depend strongly on task arrival times. Not suitable for real-time systems. Shortest Job First (SJF): pick the task with the shortest computation time Optimal: minimized average response time Non-preemptive Not optimal for real-time in the sense of feasibility Priority Scheduling: each task is assigned a priority, the highest priority goes first Preemptive Can be static or dynamic Online Starvation: low priority tasks may experience very long delays due to preemptive by high priority tasks. To handle starvation, we can implement aging: priority increases with waiting time. Round Robin (RR): the ready queue is FCFS, then each task has a Q unit of time (quantum) to execute after Q time is placed in the back of the queue. All processes run all the time (no starvation) Shortest jobs complete first “Fairly” split resources Delta: the amount of time needed to switch between tasks, context switch time But how does any of this relate to the Senate and Congress as a whole? The idea is to increase efficiency within our bill-making process. We want better and more thorough bills faster. In most cases, the Round Robin Scheduling approach is used as it creates an appearance of a smooth working system as all tasks appear to run at the same time. In the context of the Senate, this seems to be a valid approach as most bills (besides the annual budget) are worth equal footing to the whole of the US. As the tasks that are queued into a processor usually only deal with and concern themselves, all bills that are processed in Congress should be under the single-subject rule. This not only allows Congress to deal in one relative logical realm at a time but also gets rid of the nonsensical tool of a “rider” or “wrecking amendment”.

But even with that, it is true to say that it is the strongest and most powerful system that is in place today (2021). We can add higher-order Socialist terms to help correct some of the downfalls of Capitalism, but switching to Socialism, as our economic system would not be beneficial.\nNo one has ever created a perfect system on the first try, or even the second, or the third (we must keep in mind the asymptotic framework around the term perfect). The mindset of an engineer is to look at the current system (maybe even disregarding it as a whole), acknowledge the factors involved in optimization, and try and build better. I am sure that the integrators of capitalism into the United States of America (in 1776) did not have as much information as I have now, so I do not believe they got it perfect on their first or second go-around of thinking about these systems.\nI have no ideas what this new and better system will look like or how (at its core) it will function.

Did people even imagine that communication in the form of electricity through the telegram was even possible before it was invented?

Tribal communities of max 150-200 people had high peer-to-peer connectivity. People in the tribe knew each other very closely and personally. They had to. Without a large fictional group to be organized by, people had to actually learn and trust each other.\nBut as technology increases, the level of peer-to-peer connectivity decreases. Likewise, the number of connections does increase as technology increases. Technology, in this sense, is anything that can get better over time. The human brain is a piece of technology that can improve over time. Societies and governments are a piece of technology that can improve over time. Electronic devices are a piece of technology that can improve over time.\nAs technology increases, the number of connections allowed increases. Linearly, maybe not, but it will always increase until it approaches the full connection. But the level of peer-to-peer connectivity does not. This connectivity follows loosely with a standard cosine function. High when technology is low, low when technology is at its middle tier, and even higher, approaching max, as technology approaches its maximum.\nThe paragraph below is just an idea dump. The conclusions made could be illogical.\nThere is something to be said about the low levels of friction that are designed into social media apps or any addictively designed stimuli. For social media apps, this low level of friction is meant to make the user’s interaction with the app seamless and easy. So social interactions with friends and acquaintances are easy and painless; liking your friend’s picture is just one tap away. One interesting metric to quantify someone’s friendship with another is the question of ‘how much would you do for person x?’. If one of my friends baked me a cake from scratch, then I could conclude that this person cares a lot about our friendship. Of course, there are multiple ways to show someone you care about them, some of which do not have to include physical objects. And likewise, multiple people have different love languages. But now within our modern age, a friendly online gesture of caring is a like or a share which of course are very low effort actions. In this context, friendships that are partially maintained online include lower actions of friendship and therefore would result in a lower level of peer-to-peer connectivity. This assumes that without social media (human socialization done online), a person would be doing physical social interaction instead of using Instagram or Facebook.

Or in another abstraction, you’re attempting to run multiple programs on your computer. (The computer architecture analogy works well when dealing with systems that need to be optimized because CPU schedulers and computers in general have been optimized both on a heuristic and mathematical level. They are great examples of engineers and theorists doing amazing work.) In both of these scenarios, we have an entity that needs to manage multiple tasks. Some tasks may be of high priority, but for now each tasks needs to get done and progress relatively evenly. Now lets say one task holds on to this processing entity indefinitely because it does not want the others tasks to progress. Your computer is now frozen. Lets now explore the possibilities of why this task would freeze your computer. One possible reason of why your computer is now frozen is because the other tasks are actually malware and were going to damage your computer. We would then thank the task that froze your computer as it was protecting you. A different possibility is that this freezing task is actually the malware, and wanted to freeze your computer to halt your work. In either scenario, a corrupt task was let into your queue. This is more of a problem involving the input security of your computer and not the process scheduler.

It is just an object found in nature. It’s sharpness only arises from the action of erosion or gravity dropping it. Likewise, this rock has not been created by a human, an organism with the ability to think abstractly about things and to create with purpose. This rock, then, is probably not as sharp as your average kitchen knife, something that have been created with a purpose.\nFirst I will attempt to made some distinctions in meaning. Natural is defined as something that exists or is formed by nature. Usually in people’s minds the term nature has a relation to the outdoors: trees, animals, the ocean, mountains, etc.. So something that is created by humans is not natural. I would first like to point out that others things created by different animals than humans are natural: this is animal droppings, beaver dams, bird nests. So why is there a distinction between humans and the animal kingdom, which they are apart of? Probably rooted in some religious texts, but none the less, the earth and nature has generated all animals, so anything that humans do are natural occurrences (maybe rooting in the ideas of free will). With this being said, I would like to make a distinction between optimized outcomes (the things that most people would call un-natural) and un-optimized outcomes (the things most people would call natural).\nAs it is known now, most animals cannot create objects that are optimized past a certain point.\nWolves may decide that a certain hunting strategy is more effective than another, but they will not create wolf guns to heavily optimize for their hunting. I don’t know how beavers began building dams out of wood to create a reservoir of water to live in, but they have not developed concrete to created a more resilient home. Or maybe the time scale is too short. We started out by throwing rocks and other hard objects to hunt, and now we can kill with intercontinental ballistic missiles and drones. The laws of exponential growth is quite unimaginable for humans; it is hard to imagine and really grasp the concept of how large things can get. Maybe animal intelligence can have exponential growth from its genetic ancestors. Maybe because we are exponentially smart, our technologies grow exponentially quicker. Our technology growth with be proportional to a tetration function when compared to other animals, allowing their growth to seem as nothing while our growth increases. Well that took a heavy tangent. As I was saying, although animals can see a better path to a destination, they will not create a bridge to get there. So do animals have groups and hierarchies such as in a society, their society was not created for a purpose and appeared ‘naturally’ through hardwired code in the brain.\nWhy is it assumed that human brains are fundamentally different than other animals. We all evolved through the same fundamental mechanism, so it seems that adaptations would lie on a smooth spectrum and not a dis-continuous step-function. Are there other step-function that we can see in evolution? What happened to the animals that are in-between two connection nodes on a genetic tree?\nNow societies are mostly created by humans at their start. The leaders or founders envision a state of their future and attempt to pursued others to follow their lead. You see, to the others who are not the founder, this society was created naturally around them, and even so if you’re born into it. This causes a situation where many people are using an object without knowing it’s purpose.\n"},{"id":16,"href":"/posts/perspective/","title":"Perspective","section":"Posts","content":"Perspective (noun): the capacity to view things in their true relations or relative importance\nThe human body interfaces with the outside through our five senses: touch, sight, hearing, smell, and taste. This information from the outside world then filters through the body into the brain where it is processed. With regards to how someone sees the world, their perspective, variation can come in three different ways.\nThe first, and less complex one, is variation in our actual mechanics of gathering information from the outside world; these are the five senses stated before. People have different abilities to see, different levels of sensitivity in all of the senses. This variation, however, doesn’t cause a large perspective change from person to person. Someone with better eye-sight won’t have greater insights into the world. The raw information coming into a human many vary, but these variations are small compared to the amount of data that is actually coming in.\nThe final two variations come from how an individual’s brain develops. Commonly stated in psychology as Nature vs. Nurture. Your brain, how you think and react, your whole conscience, are developed and formed by both the environment around you and your genetics. The factor each one plays in your overall development is the question of the problem, but I believe nurture has a stronger effect on the average human. As the above variation considered one’s ability to collect this outside data, the nurture aspect of the problem deals with the type of outside data being collected. And this is where I believe humans develop the greatest variation in their perspectives of the world.\nWith this starting place, it is hard to fault people for having poor perspectives and how these perspectives develop into opinions. Of course, people do have some room to maneuver through their environmental inputs and conclude as they wish, with a higher maneuvering room being a sought after trait maybe leading into intelligence, but a lot of the time it is hard to change someone’s perspective on a topic if they have been exposed to only one idea for most of their life. Not only that, but different groups of humans often get different types of outside data.\nSomewhere within this website, maybe on the Empathy page, there is the idea of trust. Trusting someone’s opinion on a certain topic or a plan of action for a certain problem because you do not have all the relevant data to make an informed opinion. Now empathy describes the idea of understanding someone on the basis of a shared experience, but I do not have, nor can ever experience, the raw data from the outside that a girl grows up with or a woman lives with. I do not know the lived experiences that females face in America, nor the experience of being Black in America. Different groups of humans will have different perspectives on life, and will therefore develop different opinions about ideas within our world. Humans of two different groups may read the same news article and form very different opinions about the topics presented in that article. Now I doubt one human had better eye-sight than the other and therefore could see deeper into the words of the article and develop a differing opinion from the other with the comparatively poor eye-sight. People develop different perspectives because they live different lives.\nThis is where the trust comes in. I am not a female and therefore have do not know what the world feels, looks, sounds, smells, or tastes like to a female. Following that, I do not know what it feels like to birth a child, to carry that child in me for nine months, no maybe not even want that child in the first place, or to have the power sucked from me if there is no other choice but to carry through with having that child. But women do; they know the perspective of being a woman. So I trust them in their opinions about a topic only a woman can know. I can only sympathize if that. So if I trust these people to take actions that are for the betterment of our world, then I should adopt their opinion in an attempt to complete and data-driven.\n"},{"id":17,"href":"/posts/real-game-value/","title":"Real Game Value","section":"Posts","content":"Injecting real world value into video games.

Sympathy is regarded as sharing the emotional feeling with someone as they are having it, while empathy is understanding the emotional feeling that someone is having. These words do not refer to the process that occurs to get to this sharing or understanding. Does someone understand the feeling because they have been in that situation or because they are emotionally equipped to find the path to that feeling, I think the former truly pins down ‘understanding’. For sharing, however, I can share the emotion through conjuring up my understanding of it with my past experiences, or I can share the emotion because of my strong human connection with the person who is having it. I think sympathy points more towards the latter. But what if I don’t have any experience with the emotion or situation that a person is in, and I don’t have any human connection with the person having that experience? If I am intellectually sound and emotionally matured, I believe I could get to an understanding of the other’s emotional experience. Maybe not a full understanding, but one that could create some type of bridge or a conversation to start a human connection. But what if this person is your average Joe, without the human connection with another or any experience with the emotional situation they are in? How do we connect these two humans together so they care about each other’s wellbeing? Now I do not think we are allowed to force these two people to be friends, or place one in the other’s experience to gain the emotional understanding. But I am allowed to teach people tools and concepts that will push their mind into sharing or understanding. The only way to attempt to teach understanding would be to break down the situation that the other is in. This is what is usually does in advertisements for charities. The other path is to attempt to connect people through the shared experience of being humans.\nBy understanding the shared experience of being human, caring about the well-being of others can easily be followed logically. The beginning assumption, that has proved true time and time again, in the vast majority of samples, is that parents and children care for each other deeply. I can assume with a high level of certainty that you love your parents if you know them, and you love your children if you have them. This is why parents support a child for 18 years, and sometimes longer. With that assumption, it follows that a parent would love the children of their children. You can see where I am going with this. So we now have an emotionally connected family tree with all entities caring about the well-being of all other entities. This can also be understood through a biological lens of wanting your genes to live on into the future. But how do we connection family tree to family tree?\nThis is where empathy of understanding comes in. A parent will feel deep emotional pain with the pain of one of their children. As do you, if you have children, feel emotional pain with the pain of your child. You therefore should understand and empathize with, deeply, the sight of another parent in emotional destress as they see their child in pain. This bi-directional emotional connection from family member to family member, as well as the understanding empathetical connection from family tree to family tree should in theory connect every human on an emotional level.\n"},{"id":23,"href":"/posts/follow-your-dreams/","title":"Follow Your Dreams","section":"Posts","content":"Choose the path that you want to take.

But I want my contribution to be more broad than that.\nWhen presented\n"},{"id":27,"href":"/posts/why-humans-collect/","title":"Why Humans Collect","section":"Posts","content":"The objective biology of it\nWe want to live to reproduce\nBut why would anyone want to live in pain?\nWhat does better mean?\nWe collect to make everyone’s lives better\nIf you have ever received coaching or tips when generating a start-up, one common action is creating a mission statement. On the surface, mission statements seem to be an advertisement or public relation trick to boost the reputation of your company, and it some cases this maybe true. Your CTO may just want to focus on research and development and have nothing to do with this image that our mission statement portrays. But the reason start-ups need to create a mission statement with detail and thought as early as is accessible to them is the same reason why navigators use the North Star when taking upon a treacherous journey, for guidance and grounding. You need a strong goal to guide your decision making.\nWhen you have a goal in mind, there is usually a starting point and an ending point. I want to finish this book, I want to run a marathon, I want to create a company that sells books online. Some of these goals produce journeys that are short, some produce journeys that are long, some have a textbook path already laid out, and some are paths less traveled, or not traveled at all. If you want to do something big, a goal is necessary creation.\nAnother path to really understand the goal of your mission is to ask why. Like any good scientist will do, the process of asking \u0026lsquo;why?\u0026rsquo; will both test your knowledge stack of the specific topic you are dealing with and also teach you about concepts you are missing or haven\u0026rsquo;t thought about yet. This can also be seen as a first principles way of thinking; understand all the fundamentals that make up the lowest level of your topic and build up the correct path and design to achieve your goal.\n"}]
