When investigating anything, a question of \u0026ldquo;why\u0026rdquo; can be asked at any level of the system. If we keep asking why, we will inevitably reach the discipline of physics, where the language is mathematics. To understand is to quantify, and if things are too heuristic or qualitative, we must create a mapping or model to understand.\nOn the surface, many systems are understood in a heuristic manner. A loose combination of words and feelings with no real rigor towards a mathematically defined understanding. Think of things like a feeling of angry or the taste of a steak with a hint of rosemary. Without much thought these things are described and understood with a string of words and your own personal conscious and subconscious feelings. However, this does not mean that these things cannot be scientifically understood. A feeling of angry can be defined by certain levels of neurotransmitters or neuropeptides, which is caused by some stimuli, then affecting higher level bodily functions such as body temperature or arousal. As taste can be descried by the levels of certain molecules and how these are interpreted by your taste buds.\nLimitations of Logic # A tangent from the above section in necessary. Like in most sciences, one can pledge their time to theory or experiment. These often progress a differing rates; sometimes our theory cannot be experimentally proven with the current technology, and sometimes experimental observations cannot be understood through theory. This dynamic, the attempt to understand and to use, can be seen as an optimization problem in other areas of life.\nAlthough the goal of any scientific person is to understand through theory, waiting to solve a problem until you have perfectly mapped out all the mechanisms is not advantageous for society (this is akin to waiting until you have the perfect setup before starting a project or learning a new skill, it is procrastination). So although we would like to create mathematical representations for our problems, roadblocks when creating this representation cannot holt our main object, to solve the problem at hand.\nIn the area of politics and society, heavy theory or a mathematical representation of problems and guiding principles lack maturity and scientific rigor. This is not because the social sciences lack intelligent people. The low-level mechanics of these topics is the human conscience. These humans interact with other humans with scaling principles that can be seen on the macro level. The macro can be observed and studied through communities and countries, but these observations are on natural experiments, ones where variables are sometimes unknown and unaccounted for. So why not have macro level experiments? There are many reason, some ethical, some through experimental bias, why we cannot experiment on whole societies and countries. So why not have simulations? For real and complex simulations, an understanding of each individual unit (this tracking an atom, but now we are tracking human action and thought) is necessary. This is where the theory becomes harder. Bla Bla Bla. We have not solve human consciousness.\nArithmetic of the Abstract # Optimizing Human Happiness # Integrals over time and summations over people are the main two operations th\nLet try to write a simple model for human happiness.\nFirst, we will assume that happiness is a scalar, just a regular value, say $h \\in \\mathbb{R}$. So how do we calculate happiness? To be simple, we will say that happiness $h$ is a function of multiple variables $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$. I do not how many variables go into defining human happiness, or the nature of these variables (positive things), so we will assume a simple model of three variables $x_i \\in \\mathbb{R}$ for $1 \\leq i \\leq 3$.\nSo now we have a function with multiple variables, that are all assumed to be continuous, with a function that is assumed to be continuous, we can start analyzing it with multiple variable calculus, and start observing its behavior.\nSo with one human, what are some factors (variables) that go into determining (calculating) their happiness? The time of the day does affect a person\u0026rsquo;s happiness, but not directly. Other factors like energy, hungry, and their significant other\u0026rsquo;s happiness score. These variable choice are also not easy to handle.\nenergy is another arbitrary value of this person\u0026rsquo;s life that would also need a discussion to figure out. hungry is a more refind value; its calculation is somewhat scientifically defined, or could easily be defined as linearly decreasing function with respect to time. Once initialize, its value decreases as $-bt$ where $t$ is time and $b$ is some value correlated with a person\u0026rsquo;s metabolism. Here, we use the help of other scientific research to define our base values. their significant other\u0026rsquo;s happiness score open up the connect to others, that more comples relationship between variables occurs. Multiple objects appear in one space, or that at every time step (must be much less than all human time scales, but large enough to help runtime), a calculate is done, which will involve multiple other function to call, doing more calculations.

We will leave the discussion of the nature of these rules for later, and focus on how to treat and process the ‘rule breakers’. Lets first start with the trivial solution.\nThe trivial solution would be that of zero, doing nothing. If the thought of doing nothing to a person who breaks a particular rule seems reasonable, then the rule itself is probably at fault for the illogical solution. Lets take an easy example, murder. Pondered elsewhere in this website, the goal of building a society includes actively promoting the well-being of your citizens. The killing of one of your citizens, therefore, goes in direct opposition of this goal and should prompt the creation of a rule. Now if someone murders another, going in direct opposition of the goal of the society, the ‘rule break’ process should trigger. If this process is the trivial solution, i.e. no process, this person may murder again. This solution is not the society actively promoting the well-being of their citizens and should be concluded to be incorrect. If we look to another example of theft, a similar conclusion should be made; this theft is most likely decreasing the well-being of the person at the other end of the theft and is then a concern of the society at large (But it is increasing the well-being of the person who is stealing! Discussion of this point inquiries into the timeline of crime and average well-being as well as why people creak rules in the first place. I will hopefully discuss this later.)\nLets jump rapidly to the opposite end of the solution spectrum to execution. This is a quick and dirty way of dealing with citizens that break the rules. The only pro, and I mean only, is that this person cannot break any more rules in your society. The cons list is quite deep, but I will explain a few. First, this person may be a citizen of your society so executing them should be classified under opposite to promoting the well-being of your citizens. Moreover on this point, who givens anyone the authority to take the life of another human being? Self-defense and war are more nuanced examples, but when their are options that don’t involve the killing of another human, these are the better paths to take. You can sentiment of ‘an eye for an eye’ in ancient laws such as Hammurabi’s Code, but as the hard-to-trace quote goes “An eye for an eye will leave everyone blind.” Taking the life of another should be a last resort decision, so what solutions fall between an action of nothing and of execution?\nThe United States’ prison system needs reform. The first weird property is the fact that there exist private prisons that are not run by the government. As a baseline, allowing a private company to profit off the functionality or rule of a law does not help the citizens under that governance. An example of this is private car insurance companies; quite a lucrative business model for a mandatory rule by the government. And yet again we see this with private prisons. Profiting off a mandatory functionality of the land seems to be an act of ripping off the citizens. It is not a choice of the consumer anymore; they do not have the power to withhold purchasing if the private companies do not fit their needs. Moreover, profiting off the rehabilitation of your other citizens is immoral and improper in a connected society. So it is clear that the running of prisons should not be done in the private sector, but what else needs to be done to improve their functionality? First, we must go back and think to ourselves of ‘why do we have prisons in the first place?’ It seems that some actions must be taken against a citizen who does something illegal, immoral, or improper.\n"},{"id":4,"href":"/posts/empathy/","title":"Empathy","section":"Blog","content":"One of the major building blocks of society is empathy.\nTo create a society that will help each other on multiple levels, empathy is needed to connect each member of the community.\nEmpathy alone cannot get your society to the full connection that is needed, there must also be an aspect of trust.\nAs the topic of page was first about empathy, which seems to be very important to people, I have developed a transition to maybe the more important sympathy.\nI don’t think sympathy and empathy create the full spectrum needed to connect emotionally with another human. Sympathy is regarded as sharing the emotional feeling with someone as they are having it, while empathy is understanding the emotional feeling that someone is having. These words do not refer to the process that occurs to get to this sharing or understanding. Does someone understand the feeling because they have been in that situation or because they are emotionally equipped to find the path to that feeling, I think the former truly pins down ‘understanding’. For sharing, however, I can share the emotion through conjuring up my understanding of it with my past experiences, or I can share the emotion because of my strong human connection with the person who is having it. I think sympathy points more towards the latter. But what if I don’t have any experience with the emotion or situation that a person is in, and I don’t have any human connection with the person having that experience? If I am intellectually sound and emotionally matured, I believe I could get to an understanding of the other’s emotional experience. Maybe not a full understanding, but one that could create some type of bridge or a conversation to start a human connection. But what if this person is your average Joe, without the human connection with another or any experience with the emotional situation they are in? How do we connect these two humans together so they care about each other’s wellbeing? Now I do not think we are allowed to force these two people to be friends, or place one in the other’s experience to gain the emotional understanding. But I am allowed to teach people tools and concepts that will push their mind into sharing or understanding. The only way to attempt to teach understanding would be to break down the situation that the other is in. This is what is usually does in advertisements for charities. The other path is to attempt to connect people through the shared experience of being humans.\nBy understanding the shared experience of being human, caring about the well-being of others can easily be followed logically. The beginning assumption, that has proved true time and time again, in the vast majority of samples, is that parents and children care for each other deeply. I can assume with a high level of certainty that you love your parents if you know them, and you love your children if you have them. This is why parents support a child for 18 years, and sometimes longer. With that assumption, it follows that a parent would love the children of their children. You can see where I am going with this. So we now have an emotionally connected family tree with all entities caring about the well-being of all other entities. This can also be understood through a biological lens of wanting your genes to live on into the future. But how do we connection family tree to family tree?\nThis is where empathy of understanding comes in. A parent will feel deep emotional pain with the pain of one of their children. As do you, if you have children, feel emotional pain with the pain of your child. You therefore should understand and empathize with, deeply, the sight of another parent in emotional destress as they see their child in pain. This bi-directional emotional connection from family member to family member, as well as the understanding empathetical connection from family tree to family tree should in theory connect every human on an emotional level.\n"},{"id":5,"href":"/posts/freedom/","title":"Freedom","section":"Blog","content":"On the surface, freedom sounds like an amazing feature to have in your society. Why should I have people telling me how I can live my life? But even with that question, I can already see a flaw. Laws are clearly needed in a society, but they limit my freedom. So maybe freedom is not as strong as we first thought.\nThe question for building any society to break down the needed and desired features. With this, you will also need to provide the goal of your society, something to guide the implementers in their quest. Without this baseline goal (may sometimes be compared to that of a mission statement in another reading), the reasoning and decisions for you implementation are backed by nothing.\nA wonderful framework for thinking about why humans (the goal) build a society is through tribal society and living. This framework takes advantage of the Dunbar number. In this tribal society, members know and trust everyone around them. So they should expect the best out of each other, not only because they need to survive together but also because these people are friends, so a treatment of respect is expected.\nIndividualism is somewhat of a myth generated by a heavy swing opposite from the monarchy of England. To say that you are a true individual is physically and factually wrong. The life you live today, the materials that are in front of you, and the relationships you hold, are all a product of a community effort. Even your own personal experiences and thoughts have been shaped by the people around you. Arguably everything you know has been touched and affected by other humans, both known and unknown. This individualistic mindset also shortens the scope at which you think. In their day-to-day lives, how many people think 10 generations after them, both in and out of their future heritage? The scope of the problems they think about is small; they do not worry about how the collective society will live 200 years down the line. People tend to worry about their individual problems, and if we are lucky, the problems of their family and friends. This is not completely their fault, however, as the variety of problems an individual faces, in developed western countries that is, can often be that of the mind. After working your generic 9-5, you face problems of your happiness, you People living in poverty, too, face problems that have consequences in the very short term. People need to feed themselves and their families, they need to pay their bills and, as a result, trade their time for a solution to these problems. Why would someone with depression or someone without money to feed themselves or their children care about the humans who will live 200 years from now?\nLet us dive deep into this broad statement \u0026ldquo;Individualism is somewhat of a myth generated by a heavy swing opposite from the monarchy of England..\u0026rdquo;\nTaken from the Individualism Wikipediap page, \u0026ldquo;Individualism is the moral stance, political philosophy, ideology and social outlook that emphasizes the intrinsic worth of the individual. Individualists promote the exercise of one\u0026rsquo;s goals and desires and to value independence and self-reliance and advocate that interests of the individual should achieve precedence over the state or a social group while opposing external interference upon one\u0026rsquo;s own interests by society or institutions such as the government. Individualism is often defined in contrast to totalitarianism, collectivism and more corporate social forms.\nIt seems that the term \u0026ldquo;was first introducted as a pejorative by utopian socialists such as the Owenites in the late 1830s, although it is unclear if they were influenced by Saint-Simonianism or came up with it independently\u0026rdquo; Etymology, Individualism\nFreedom must also be defined. Today in American politics, and life in general, the word \u0026lsquo;freedom\u0026rsquo; or \u0026lsquo;being free\u0026rsquo; carries more connation than it health for such an important idea. America\u0026rsquo;s strong emotional connection to this word has historical context; ideas of freedom and liberty were some of the roots that grounded the American Revolution. During this revolutionary era the idea of freedom was more concrete. Colonists could look easily point to their English rulers and dream of a society outside the boundary of their authority. This idea of freedom, for the majority of the colonists, was crude and heavily circumstantial, but it didn\u0026rsquo;t need to be a thorough, it just needed to be developed enough to start and end the revolution. Although America is still young, we are not at this underdeveloped stage anymore; our definition of \u0026lsquo;freedom\u0026rsquo; should, therefore, not be as well.\nThe stress on the development of the idea of freedom is not a random one. It is one of the groundworks for the American Experiment, but an appeal to tradition is not what is driving this thought. Freedom of thought, of expression, personal freedom, these are all ideas that seem to represent a positive society. And I\u0026rsquo;m sure the Founding Fathers knew why they were picking this pillar to build upon. So what is freedom exactly, and how is it integrated into your society and life?\nAs is common with exploring the spectrum of an idea, we will look first at the extreme and see how we develop from there. One the first side of the spectrum we have absolute freedom. With this a person is free to do whatever action they please. They can kill, they can build, they can think and shout. Place this absolutely free person in a world by themselves, and there seems to be no conflict. If we add other people, however, certain allowed actions seem undesirable. If two humans are absolutely free interact, fighting and murder is on the table. And if these people need to work together inside of a societal unit, one killing the other would be at the detriment of the society at large. Point being: absolute freedom is not the freedom we are looking to implement in our society. Even if Americans don\u0026rsquo;t realize this, it is already build into the United States legal system. People are forced to abide by the rule of law, to pay taxes, and give up their time to attend jury duty,\nNow lets look at the other side of the spectrum. I don\u0026rsquo;t think a strong debate is needed to turn away from a society with absolutely no freedom or autonomy. We all can agree that any form of slavery is terrible and it seems completely undesirable to have no control under any or your choices or actions. Point being: people should be allowed to do what they want and have autonomy in their lives.\nSo how do we logical combine these two points: one of avoiding absolute freedom while still letting people act as they please? Where to we cross the line between a free personal action and one that causes destress in your society?\n"},{"id":6,"href":"/posts/perspective/","title":"Perspective","section":"Blog","content":"Perspective (noun): the capacity to view things in their true relations or relative importance\nThe human body interfaces with the outside through our five senses: touch, sight, hearing, smell, and taste. This information from the outside world then filters through the body into the brain where it is processed. With regards to how someone sees the world, their perspective, variation can come in three different ways.\nThe first, and less complex one, is variation in our actual mechanics of gathering information from the outside world; these are the five senses stated before. People have different abilities to see, different levels of sensitivity in all of the senses. This variation, however, doesn’t cause a large perspective change from person to person. Someone with better eye-sight won’t have greater insights into the world. The raw information coming into a human many vary, but these variations are small compared to the amount of data that is actually coming in.\nThe final two variations come from how an individual’s brain develops. Commonly stated in psychology as Nature vs. Nurture. Your brain, how you think and react, your whole conscience, are developed and formed by both the environment around you and your genetics. The factor each one plays in your overall development is the question of the problem, but I believe nurture has a stronger effect on the average human. As the above variation considered one’s ability to collect this outside data, the nurture aspect of the problem deals with the type of outside data being collected. And this is where I believe humans develop the greatest variation in their perspectives of the world.\nWith this starting place, it is hard to fault people for having poor perspectives and how these perspectives develop into opinions. Of course, people do have some room to maneuver through their environmental inputs and conclude as they wish, with a higher maneuvering room being a sought after trait maybe leading into intelligence, but a lot of the time it is hard to change someone’s perspective on a topic if they have been exposed to only one idea for most of their life. Not only that, but different groups of humans often get different types of outside data.\nSomewhere within this website, maybe on the Empathy page, there is the idea of trust. Trusting someone’s opinion on a certain topic or a plan of action for a certain problem because you do not have all the relevant data to make an informed opinion. Now empathy describes the idea of understanding someone on the basis of a shared experience, but I do not have, nor can ever experience, the raw data from the outside that a girl grows up with or a woman lives with. I do not know the lived experiences that females face in America, nor the experience of being Black in America. Different groups of humans will have different perspectives on life, and will therefore develop different opinions about ideas within our world. Humans of two different groups may read the same news article and form very different opinions about the topics presented in that article. Now I doubt one human had better eye-sight than the other and therefore could see deeper into the words of the article and develop a differing opinion from the other with the comparatively poor eye-sight. People develop different perspectives because they live different lives.\nThis is where the trust comes in. I am not a female and therefore have do not know what the world feels, looks, sounds, smells, or tastes like to a female. Following that, I do not know what it feels like to birth a child, to carry that child in me for nine months, no maybe not even want that child in the first place, or to have the power sucked from me if there is no other choice but to carry through with having that child. But women do; they know the perspective of being a woman. So I trust them in their opinions about a topic only a woman can know. I can only sympathize if that. So if I trust these people to take actions that are for the betterment of our world, then I should adopt their opinion in an attempt to complete and data-driven.\n"}]
