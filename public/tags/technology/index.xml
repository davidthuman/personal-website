      <description>I have tried to start making this.
The concept of creating some type of application, whether that be a website, app, etc., first came through my mind around senior year of high school. The idea of the website ‘wethepeople.com’ at first was going to be site where clear, detailed information about politics, elections, Congress would be easily accessible to all. I wanted summaries of legislature that were going through Congress, outlines of candidates’ polices and ideas, as well as a history of all politician’s past action for an increased amount of accountability.</description>

      <description>Injecting real world value into video games. Often people implicate monetary values to in-game items but they have no other value except happiness. I want to somehow link work in the video game into work like data processing or computation.
maybe could be a rendering thing, people play the game and render the new world and send this data back to the devs.</description>
